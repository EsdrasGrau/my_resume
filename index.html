        <h2>PROJECTS</h2>
        <h4>FB Prophet (Time Series) Forecasting, practical application</h4>
        <p>
          This project has the goal to reduce cost and optimize the resources of
          a Japanse bakery where I collaborate using a TimeSeries predictor
          FBProphet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prophet is open source software released by Facebookâ€™s Core Data
          Science team. Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data
          based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with
          yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects.

        <h4>Python BI project applying MongoDB & Folium</h4>
        <p>
          For this project, I chose a certain Japanese bakery with 107 years of
          history that originally started in Seattle, USA. As expansion project,
          they are interested in going back to Seattle, the company hometown and
          have a location where they can showcase their long history and be part
          of one of the most vibrant cities in the USA.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seattle is home to some of the greatest companies in the world like
          Amazon, Boeing, Costco, Starbucks and others... is time to take our
          place too.

        <h4>Web Scraping to obtain historical weather data</h4>
        <p>
          For this project I took all the sales transactions of 2019 of certain
          Japanese company (one location) and decided to add weather historical
          data and national holidays info to each transaction.
